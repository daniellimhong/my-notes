## Kinesthetic:

**Your Quote:** *“The very first priority is to apply it, practice it and make it work.”*

**Your Style:** You want more experiences so you can understand things. The ideas on this page are only valuable if they sound practical, real and relevant to you. You need to do things to understand.

**Your Leadership:** is based on action, personal examples and role modelling. *“Follow me and I will show you what we can achieve.”*

**Feedback**: is based on face-to-face discussions with examples of projects showing success or failure.

## **Aural:**

**Your Quote:** *“Those who speak well hold the key to leadership.”*

**Your Style:** You prefer to have this page explained to you. The written words are not as valuable as those you hear. You will probably go and tell somebody about this.

**Your Leadership:** is based on meetings, discussion and emailed or phoned instructions. *“Let’s exchange some ideas and work towards a shared understanding of the issues.”*

**Feedback**: is based on discussions and a chance to collect oral feedback or make your case as well as to listen, question and respond.
